// The controllers folder is where you typically define the logic for handling 
// requests and responses in your Express application. It separates the concerns 
// of routing and request handling, making your code more modular and easier 
// to maintain.

// In the controllers folder, you will define functions that handle the actual 
// logic of processing requests (like creating, reading, updating, or deleting 
// data). These controller functions are then referenced in the routes, 
// keeping your routes clean and focused on mapping HTTP requests to specific 
// controller actions.
