# CAPSTONE - Cookie Jar Karma (CJK)

## Frontend Setup
1. Created a new folder on my local machine.
2. Created a new repository on GitHub.
3. Ran `npm create vite@latest` in the terminal.
4. Used `cd cjk_v1` (changed directory to get into the project).
5. Ran `npm install`.
6. Ran `npm run dev` (CTRL+click to open the project in the browser).
7. Removed all unnecessary boilerplate code.
8. Restructured to separate frontend from backend, creating the appropriate skeleton. 

## Backend Setup
1. Installed the following using npm --
- express: Backend framework for routing and handling requests.
- mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- cors: Middleware to manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
- validator: To validate user inputs (e.g., emails).
- bcrypt: To hash passwords securely.
- jsonwebtoken: For generating and verifying authentication tokens.

2. Set Up the Project Structure
3. Set Up .env File
4. Create the Express Server (server.js)
5. Set Up Mongoose Models
6. Set Up Routes (Optional)
7. Test the Server
 

## Introduction
Cookie Jar Karma is a micro-donation platform designed to allow individuals to make small contributions to charitable causes, aiming to help them alleviate guilt from everyday actions.

## Capstone Objective
Create a full-stack web application using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node (MERN).**

## Deadline
The complete application is due by **11:59pm on 03/19/2025.**

## Submission
Submit the <a href="https://github.com/dsus121/_Capstone">GitHub link</a> on Canvas.
https://github.com/dsus121/_Capstone
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Your presentation should include:
1. A demonstration of the application.
2. An overview of the challenges you endured, and how you handled them.
3. A short question-and-answer period.

## Finishing Up
As you finish building your application, ask yourself the following questions:
- Did you deliver a project that met all of the technical requirements?
- Given what the class has covered, did you build something reasonably complex?
- Did you add a personal touch or a creative element into your project submission?
- Did you deliver something of value to the end-user (not just a login button and an index page)?
- Did you follow the code style guidance and exercise best practices?
- Did you provide an appropriate level of comments?
- Did you try to deploy your application to a public URL as a personal stretch goal?
